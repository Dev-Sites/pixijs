# PixiJS: The HTML5 Creation Engine

The aim of this project is to provide a fast lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. The PixiJS renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). Also, it's fast!
